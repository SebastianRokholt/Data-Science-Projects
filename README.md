# Data-Science-Projects
Various data science projects I've worked on, either in my spare time or as part of my studies at the University of Bergen. Notebooks are ordered ascendingly by completion date, so that the most recently finished project will have the highest number in the title.

Notebooks currently available:
  - [05 - Predicting Property Prices for NYC with XGBoost, SVM, MLP and Linear regression](https://github.com/SebastianRokholt/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/01%20-%20Predicting%20Property%20Prices%20for%20NYC%20with%20XGBoost%2C%20SVM%2C%20MLP%20and%20Linear%20regression.ipynb)
