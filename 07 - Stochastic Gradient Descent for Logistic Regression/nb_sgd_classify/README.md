## Installation guide
nb_sgd_classify can be installed with the Python package manager `pip`, which means that any 
programmer with access to the source code can import the package wherever they want.  

To install the package, simply extract the zipped folder with the source code to a 
folder located in your Python path, then navigate to the collopy (root) folder in your terminal. 
With Python 3 installed, run `python3 â€“m pip install .`  (dot included, in order to install the local folder) 
to install the package. It can then be imported to any Python program as usual (`import nb_sgd_classify`).
